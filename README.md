# âœ¨ Van Vuong Ngo

Hi, I am a Full-Stack developer and interested in developing applications, infrastructure- and hardware-topics.
My journey with Computers started in the 80s when I got my first PC, an Amstrad CPC464. With this 8-bit Computer I learned the BASIC ;) of a developer's skill -> I `copy & paste` a code from a computer magazine tutorial which then transformed into a game. That was a kind of mindblowing to me ...

Then one day the cable of the monitor, which is connected to the computer, had a loose contact. I looked for a screwdriver and open the monitor. That was my second wow ... this is what it looks like from the inside.
